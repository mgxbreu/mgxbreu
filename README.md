- 👋 Hi, I’m Mariam Garcia
- 👀 I’m interested in NLP, ML and Phonetics (yeah pretty cool mix to work on a speech related project, I know)
- 👷🏽‍♂️ But that's not all. I'm also a Frontend developer, you can see my projects on my online [portfolio](https://my-portafolio-orcin.vercel.app/). I used Gatsby, GraphQL and Tailwind to create it.
- 💞️ I love creating projects that challenge me and help me put my knowledge to use.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can contact me on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mgxbreu/) on business hours because contrary to popular belief developers need to sleep too when they're not working.
- 😉 I’m also a [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/mgxbreu) member

I'll be waiting for you, but don't take too long because I'll be working on something great any time soon 😏

Have a nice one.
